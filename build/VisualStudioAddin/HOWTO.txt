Installation:
Copy both .addin file and .dll to one of the AddIns folder
of Visual Studio (See Options dialog in Visual Studio for list).
Or: Add to Tools->Options->Addin and Macro security, add the folder
    <bin/Release> or <bin/Debug>
    
Debugging: Add <bin/Debug> to Addin paths, delete the dll from <bin/Debug>
           and start the Addin solution (if the dll is already found when
           opening this solution, it cannot be rebuilt since it is in use)
