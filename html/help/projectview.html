Individual files stored on disk can be added via
the popup menu that is shown when right clicking a folder and
then selecting the 'Add -> File(s) from disk' menu option.

<h2>Add complete folders from disk</h2>

Instead of adding files one-by-one, it is possible to add a complete
disk hierarchy in one action. To do so, select the popup menu item
'Add -> Folder from disk'. The selected folder is then added, and so is it's
contents.

in the project view.

To add a folder, right click on a folder in the tree and
select the 'New -> Folder' option in the popup menu.

<h2>Create a sequence</h2>

To create a new empty sequence right click on a folder in the tree and
select the 'New -> Sequence' option in the popup menu.

To create a new sequence filled with all the files in a certain folder,
right click on that folder and select the 'Create sequence' menu option.
