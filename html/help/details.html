<h1>Details</h1>

When a clip is selected in the timeline, the details view gives options to edit the clip.
When a edit operation is in progress (currently: only trimming) the details view gives information on that operation.

<h2>Clip details</h2>

In the clip details view, the following can be edited:
<ul>
<li>The length of the clip can be changed to one of the predefined lengths. <br><i>Note that the buttons are customizable via the config file (Help &rarr; Config file, then edit 'LengthButtonsTimesInMilliseconds')<i>
<li>The opacity of the clip can be changed. For sequences with multiple tracks this means that clips in 'lower' tracks become visible when reducing a clip's opacity.
<li>The scaling options can be changed. Use any of the predefined scaling methods, or choose 'custom' to set the scaling factor yourselves.
    <ul>
    <li>Fit all<br>Scale the clip such that it fit completely within the resulting video. Black bars may be added.
    <li>Fit to fill<br>Scale the clip such that it fills the resulting video as much as possible, with the least video being cut off.
    <li>original size<br>Keep the clip's original size.
    <li>Custom<br>Set the scaling factor yourselves. This method is automatically selected when adjusting the scaling slider.
    </ul>
<li>The alignment options can be changed. Use any of the predefined alignment methods, or choose 'custom' to set the video position yourselves.
    <ul>
    <li>Centered<br>The clip is centered on the output video.
    <li>Centered horizontally<br>The clip is centered on the output video, but only horizontally.
    <li>Centered vertically<br>The clip is centered on the output video, but only vertically.
    <li>Custom<br>Set the X and Y position yourselves.
    </ul>
</ul>
    

<h2>Trim details</h2>

During trimming, the details view shows both the original and the resulting length (as a result of trimming) of the selected clip.
