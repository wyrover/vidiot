<h1>Drag and drop from file system</h1>

<h2>Automatically create projects</h2>

If no project is open, dropping files/folders from the filesystem results in
creation of a project. All dropped files/folders are included in this project.
<p>
If exactly one folder is dropped the initial name of the project equals the folder name.
<p>
If exactly one folder is dropped, and that folder contains no subfolders, a sequence 
is created containing all the files in the folder.
<p>
If a list of files is dropped, a sequence containing these files is created.
<p>
Note that if there are multiple video frame rates and/or audio sample rates in the
files added to the project, then the sequence is not created (because it is then 
unclear which frame/sample rate to use for the resulting video).

<h2>Drag and drop into an existing project</h2>

If a project is open, dropped files and/or folders are included into the project view.
