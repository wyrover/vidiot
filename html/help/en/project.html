<h2>Create new project</h2>

Select the 'File' menu and then select 'New' to create a new project. This will start the wizard for creating a new project.
The new project becomes visible in the <a href="projectview.html">Project View</a> with a generated name.

<h2>Rename project</h2>

To change the current name of a project select the 'File' menu and then select
'Save As' to save the project with a different name.
The project is saved as &lt;name&gt;.vid.
After saving, the project name is updated in the Project View.

<h1>Create project via drag and drop from file system</h1>

If no project is open, dropping files/folders from the filesystem results in creation of a project.
If a folder is dropped a sequence is created containing all the files in the folder.
If a list of files is dropped, a sequence containing these files is created.
<p>
Note that if there are multiple video frame rates and/or audio sample rates in the
files added to the project, then the sequence is created using the frame/sample rate
that is most frequent in the input files.
