<h1>Details</h1>

When a clip is selected in the timeline, the details view gives options to edit the clip.
When a edit operation is in progress (currently: only trimming) the details view gives information on that operation.

<h2>Clip details</h2>

In the clip details view, the following can be edited:
<ul>
<li>The length of the clip can be changed to one of the predefined lengths.
    <br><i>The buttons are customizable via the config file (Help &rarr; Config file, then edit 'LengthButtonsTimesInMilliseconds')</i>
<li>The speed of a video clip can be changed. Audio clip speed cannot be edited (yet).
    <br>Video speed can only be edited if there are no clips present in other tracks, in the same timeframe as the to-be-changed video clip.
    <br><i>The start and end frame of the video are kept 'the same' as much as possible when changing the speed. 
	However, this is not always possible (particularly, when increasing the speed).</i>
<li>The opacity of the clip can be changed. For sequences with multiple tracks this means that clips in 'lower' tracks become visible when reducing a clip's opacity.
<li>The scaling options can be changed. Use any of the predefined scaling methods, or choose 'custom' to set the scaling factor yourselves.
    <ul>
    <li>Fit all<br>Scale the clip such that it fit completely within the resulting video. Black bars may be added.
    <li>Fit to fill<br>Scale the clip such that it fills the resulting video as much as possible, with the least video being cut off.
    <li>original size<br>Keep the clip's original size.
    <li>Custom<br>Set the scaling factor yourselves. This method is automatically selected when adjusting the scaling slider.
    </ul>
<li>The alignment options can be changed. Use any of the predefined alignment methods, or choose 'custom' to set the video position yourselves.
    <ul>
    <li>Centered<br>The clip is centered on the output video.
    <li>Centered horizontally<br>The clip is centered on the output video, but only horizontally.
    <li>Centered vertically<br>The clip is centered on the output video, but only vertically.
    <li>Custom<br>Set the X and Y position yourselves.
    </ul>
<li>For audio clips, the volume can be changed from 0 to 100.
</ul>

<h2>Key frames</h2>

Changed settings in the details view apply to all frames of a clip.
It is possible to specify different settings per frame (in time) of the clip.
To do so, key frames must be added to the clips.
By specifiying different settings per key frame, the settings (over time) of the clip can be varied.

<ul>
<li>Add key frame<br>
    Select a clip in the timeline. Then, move the cursor in the timeline to the position where a key frame must be added.
    Press the 'add keyframe' button in the details view to add the key frame.
    The key frame is visualized by a yellow square in the clip in the timeline.
</li>
<li>Select key frame<br>
    Key frames can be selected in the following ways:
    <ul>
    <li>Press a numbered key frame button in the details view.
    <li>Move the cursor in the timeline to the position of a key frame of the selected clip.
    <li>Press the left mouse button over a yellow key frame indicator in the timeline.
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Delete key frame<br>
    Select a clip in the timeline and one of its key frames.
    Press the 'delete key frame' button to remove the key frame at the given position.
</li>
<li>Move key frame<br>
    The position (in time) of a key frame can be edited by left clicking a yellow key frame indicator in the timeline and then moving
    the mouse to the right or left. Note that key frames can only be moved as far as adjacent key frames, or until the end of the clip.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Important</b><br>
The first possible key frame position of a clip is the position BEFORE the first frame.
The last possible key frame position of a clip is the position AFTER the last frame. 
This has been chosen to ensure that interpolated values for the last frame are correct
(it's the value at which the final animation/fade should END).
Because the last frame of a clip ends when the first frame of the next clip is shown, 
when editing this last key frame, the first frame of the next clip is shown.

<h2>Trim details</h2>

During trimming, the details view shows both the original and the resulting length (as a result of trimming) of the selected clip.
