<h1>Details</h1>

When a clip is selected in the timeline, the details view gives options to edit the clip.
When a edit operation is in progress (currently: only trimming) the details view gives information on that operation.

<h2>Clip details</h2>

In the clip details view, the following can be edited:
<ul>
<li>The length of the clip can be changed to one of the predefined lengths.
    <br><i>The buttons are customizable via the config file (Help &rarr; Config file, then edit 'LengthButtonsTimesInMilliseconds')</i>
<li>The speed of a video clip can be changed. Audio clip speed cannot be edited (yet).
    <br>Video speed can only be edited if there are no clips present in other tracks, in the same timeframe as the to-be-changed video clip.
    <br><i>The start and end frame of the video are kept 'the same' as much as possible when changing the speed. 
	However, this is not always possible (particularly, when increasing the speed).</i>
<li>The opacity of the clip can be changed. For sequences with multiple tracks this means that clips in 'lower' tracks become visible when reducing a clip's opacity.
<li>The scaling options can be changed. Use any of the predefined scaling methods, or choose 'custom' to set the scaling factor yourselves.
    <ul>
    <li>Fit all<br>Scale the clip such that it fit completely within the resulting video. Black bars may be added.
    <li>Fit to fill<br>Scale the clip such that it fills the resulting video as much as possible, with the least video being cut off.
    <li>original size<br>Keep the clip's original size.
    <li>Custom<br>Set the scaling factor yourselves. This method is automatically selected when adjusting the scaling slider.
    </ul>
<li>The alignment options can be changed. Use any of the predefined alignment methods, or choose 'custom' to set the video position yourselves.
    <ul>
    <li>Centered<br>The clip is centered on the output video.
    <li>Centered horizontally<br>The clip is centered on the output video, but only horizontally.
    <li>Centered vertically<br>The clip is centered on the output video, but only vertically.
    <li>Custom<br>Set the X and Y position yourselves.
    </ul>
<li>For audio clips, the volume can be changed from 0 to 100.
</ul>
    

<h2>Trim details</h2>

During trimming, the details view shows both the original and the resulting length (as a result of trimming) of the selected clip.
