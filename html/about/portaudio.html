Plain English Interpretation of the License
The following is a plain English interpretation of the license. This interpretation is not part of the license and has no legal significance. To understand the full legal implications of the license you should consult the license itself.

    You can use PortAudio for free in your projects or applications, even commercial applications.
    You do not have to make your own source available as open-source code just because you used PortAudio.
    Do not take our copyright information out of the PortAudio source code.
    If you fix a bug in PortAudio, please send us the fix.
    You cannot sue us if your program fails because of PortAudio.

We are not lawyers. But the general consensus is that this license is compatible with the GNU General Public License. In other words, PortAudio can be included in a GNU project without violating the GNU license.

In terms of legal compatibility, the PortAudio licence is now a plain MIT licence, interested readers could chase up general discussions of MIT vs GPL for more information. http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
